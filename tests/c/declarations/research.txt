I direct the FuTURES-3 Lab at the University of Utah, where I lead research and train students in the areas of software and systems security.
Some high-level topics my group works on include software testing [1,2], binary analysis [3,4], vulnerability triage, and bug repair. 
Ongoing student projects include: automated testing of (1) software transpilers, and (2) binary decompilers and disassemblers; (3) designing variability-aware fuzzing techniques for testing large software product lines; (4) building new platforms for reverse engineering education; and (5) code-agnostic automated harnessing for fuzzing open- and closed-source APIs.
I am especially interested in making efficient and effective quality assurance possible for today's opaque and otherwise difficult-to-vet software and systems, with the end goal of making computing safer and more reliable for all.
